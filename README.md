# IconFontSVG

Collection for my Icons, Fonts and SVG files

Most elements to be find here were created by me, some being a derivation from 
existing and also open source elements

# License

This repo icons are released as free, open source, and GPL friendly by
the [@sdrapha](https://github.com/sdrapha/). You may use it
for commercial projects, open source projects, or anything really.

Since some of the icons are derivations from share alike icons, 
the license were embed on each SVG file, there are pretty much two in use 
Apache 2.0 or CC by 4.0

For icons from different sources which I included here for convenience, 
license and attribution were embed in the SVG files
